# MSc_Thesis_DSS_TiU
Repo for the code used for the Master's Thesis DSS.

The Preproces_EDA file contains the preprocessing and EDA. As well as initials models.
The KNN_SVC file contains all things related to KNN and SVC, as well as their versions with and without addressing class imbalance.
The GCN file contains everything related to the GCN.
The CNN file contains everything related to the CNN.
The cold start files contains the alternative preprocessing and clustering, which was later merged into permutation_V3.
The permutation files contains the PFI for all target variables with the best performing model (GCN).

It's a bit of a mess, hopefully not a problem.
